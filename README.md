# CafeMenu-CollectionView

## Description

This project is an extension of the Cafe App built using UITableViews but is replaced with a new design to replace UITableView with UICollectionView.

## What you'll learn

* How to add a UICollectionView
* Custom collection view cells by subclassing UICollectionViewCell
* UICollectionViewDataSource & UICollectionViewDelegate
* Adding Headers and Footer to UICollectionViews 

## What you'll be building

Imagine this app to compliment the Cafe business you own. This app shows all the products you sell from the wide variety of drinks, food items, and merch! Instead of customers having to use QR codes or grabbing a menu that thousands of others have touched, they can conveniently access your menu at any time through the app. Each item has its name, short description, an image, as well as its price.
